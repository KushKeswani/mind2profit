# Google Sheets Integration Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create Google Sheets
1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Create a new spreadsheet called "Mind2Profit Beta Applications"
3. Add these headers in row 1:
   ```
   Timestamp | First Name | Last Name | Email | Trading Experience | Trading Style | Current Tools | Pain Points | Expectations | Time Commitment | Device Access | Social Media | Additional Info
   ```

### 2. Get Spreadsheet ID
1. Copy the URL of your spreadsheet
2. Extract the ID (the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`)
3. Example: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ABC123.../edit` â†’ ID is `1ABC123...`

### 3. Set Up Google Cloud Project
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable Google Sheets API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click "Enable"

### 4. Create Service Account (Recommended)
1. Go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" â†’ "Service Account"
3. Fill in details and create
4. Click on the service account â†’ "Keys" â†’ "Add Key" â†’ "Create New Key" â†’ "JSON"
5. Download the JSON file and save as `service-account-key.json` in your backend folder
6. Share your Google Sheet with the service account email (found in the JSON file)

### 5. Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:
```env
GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id_here
```

### 6. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
```

## ðŸ“Š Alternative: Google Forms (Even Simpler!)

If you prefer an even simpler approach:

### 1. Create Google Form
1. Go to [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com)
2. Create a form with the same fields as your application
3. Set up the form to save responses to a Google Sheet

### 2. Replace Custom Form
1. Share the Google Form link instead of your custom form
2. Responses automatically go to Google Sheets
3. No backend integration needed!

## ðŸ”§ Testing the Integration

### Test API Endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/beta-application \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "tradingExperience": "intermediate",
    "tradingStyle": "day-trading",
    "painPoints": "Psychology",
    "expectations": "Better tools",
    "timeCommitment": "3-5-hours",
    "deviceAccess": ["desktop", "mobile"]
  }'
```

### View Applications:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/beta-applications
```

## ðŸ“§ Email Notifications

The system will still send email notifications when applications are submitted. Make sure your `.env` file has:
```env
SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=your-app-password
RECIPIENT_EMAIL=kushkeswani@mind2profit.com
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits of Google Sheets

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Permission denied** - Make sure to share the sheet with the service account email
2. **API not enabled** - Ensure Google Sheets API is enabled in your project
3. **Wrong spreadsheet ID** - Double-check the ID in your .env file
4. **Service account key missing** - Ensure the JSON file is in the backend folder

### Debug Mode:
Add this to your `.env` file to see detailed logs:
```env
DEBUG=true
```

## ðŸ“± Viewing Applications

Once set up, you can view applications by:
1. **Direct Google Sheets access** - Open the spreadsheet
2. **API endpoint** - `GET /api/beta-applications`
